The sqlalchemy exercise:

* Model the President orm class according to the data in the file, include data types as needed

* Write code that loads data the presidents.json and writes it to the db using the sqlalchemy ORM

* Verify using the sqlite GUI program that the data is there

* Using sqlalchemy ORM - filter for Democratic presidents only and display a list of them 

Hints: use `open` to open the file and json.loads to read it from json to list
