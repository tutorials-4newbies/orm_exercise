The sqlalchemy exercise:

* Model the President orm class according to the data in the file, include data types as needed

* Write code that loads data the presidents.json and writes it to the db using the sqlalchemy ORM

* Verify using the sqlite GUI program that the data is there

* Using sqlalchemy ORM - filter for Democratic presidents only and display a list of them 

Hints: use `open` to open the file and `json.loads(f)` to read it from json to list

Also: if you mess up the db, you can just erase it and start over again, it's all in a file db.db
